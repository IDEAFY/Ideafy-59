Ideafy is a cost-effective software platform designed to support the end-to-end innovation process and allow employees and/or external contributors to take an active part in the program.

Ideafy seamlessly integrates collaborative brainstorming and innovation management software into a user-friendly application for both tablets and PCs. Entirely based on web technologies (nodejs, couchdb, HTML5), the solution can be easily deployed for as many users as required with no other cost to the customer but the server license and the hardware infrastructure (in-house or PaaS) necessary to support it.
